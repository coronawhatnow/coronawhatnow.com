- **On March 13, U.S. Customs and Immigration Services announced that testing, prevention, or treatment for COVID-19 will**  **NOT**  **be used against immigrants in a public charge test.** This means that immigrant families should seek the care they need during this difficult time.  Below is some information about the rights of immigrants' rights in health care settings:
  - **It is safe and smart to see the doctor if you need care**. Your doctor is required to honor your right to privacy. You do not need to share any information about your immigration status unless you apply for Medicaid or other health coverage.
  - **You can still see a doctor without medical insurance**. This includes care you receive in the emergency room, at community and migrant health centers, free clinics, and public hospitals. If you don't have a doctor, call a local community health center for assistance. You can find a health center here: [https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)
  - **Hospitals and health care spaces are safe to visit**. Federal guidelines prohibit immigration agents from conducting arrests or other enforcement actions at health care facilities, such as hospitals, doctors' offices, health clinics, and urgent care facilities.
  - **California residents can access**[**Keep Your Benefits**](https://protectingimmigrantfamilies.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Public-Charge-Does-This-Apply-To-Me-February-2020-ENGLISH.pdf)**for more information** about how their use of public benefits may effect their documentation status.
