This will always be free for everyone. The only thing we ask is for you to contribute time, if you can. We're building an open directory of information that helps people and businesses get actionable understanding and help for the affects of coronavirus.

Here are examples of types of info we're collecting, each on a country/state/local level:
- Food access
- Financial help
- Quarantine details
- Healthcare (teledocs, drive throughs, etc)

Ideally information from state, local, federal governments and reputable companies and non-profits only.
