        <p>Co-founder of CoronaWhatNow and leads New York. Cats, cooking, cards,

          But before the distancing and diving into CoronaWhatNow.com, Nick played
          soccer a few times a week, ran, and had a full social schedule in NYC.
          While in Marketing, Nick always has his hands in side-projects.</p>
